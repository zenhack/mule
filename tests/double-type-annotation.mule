# TODO: the discussion below is based on a different architecture for the type
# checker; reframe this in terms of how the type system works now.
#
# At one point we had a bug whose cause was that we'd flipped the arguments
# to a require_subtype. The upshot was that you could break the type system
# by using nested type annotations, where the outer was a subtype of the
# inner. This is a regression test; the following should be rejected:
(4 : int) : all a. a

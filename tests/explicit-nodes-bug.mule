# This tests for a regression. The original bug was that the below would
# erroneously fail to type check, because in the return value of
# from-order, the constraint graph ends up with an equality constraint
# on something bound inside the body of the type lambda, which fails
# due to explicit binding permissions.
#
# We want references like ord.t inside the body of lambdas to be bound
# outside of it.

(* Normalize two types with respect to each other, up to whnf.

 * The exact form they are reduced to is dependent on *both* terms, but they
 * will be close enough to one another for the unification logic to do its
 * thing correctly.
 *
 * In some instances, a solution to this is a bit more natural than a single
 * normal form for an individual term.

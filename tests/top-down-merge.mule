# TODO: the comments here refer to details of an earlier version of the
# type checker, and are no longer meaningful. We should update the description
# (and maybe the name of the test).
#
# The type inference algorithm requires merging types in a "top down"
# manner. If you do bottom up instead (which is eaiser), you get something
# that is sound, but incomplete. This test checks that merges are being
# done top-down, as required.

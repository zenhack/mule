#XFAIL?
# This tests for a regression.
#
# The problem was that the below would erroneously fail to type check,
# because in the return value of from-order, the constraint graph ends
# up with an equality constraint on something bound inside the body of
# the type lambda, which fails due to explicit binding permissions.
#
# We wanted references like ord.t inside the body of lambdas to be bound
# outside of it.
#
# These concepts don't really apply anymore though...

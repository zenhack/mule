This document provides a quick crash course for Mule; it assumes the
reader is already familiar with some ML-family language (which we define
broadly; Haskell, Elm, Scala etc. count, as well as OCaml and Standard
ML obviously).

# Basics

Assuming you've successfully built and installed Mule, you can start an
interactive repl by typing `mule`:

```
$ mule
#mule>
```

## Built in types

Mule has several built-in primitive types:

* integers
* characters
* text (called "strings" in many other languages).
